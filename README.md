This repository contains the files and code required to create a machine learning model to predict the nature of barbell exercises - whether the exercise is done correctly or not.
The rmd file contains the R code required to create the model and predict values in a test set.
Both the training and test sets are included in this repository, along with two models that are time consuming computationally.
